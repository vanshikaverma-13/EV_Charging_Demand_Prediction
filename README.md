## AICTE Internship Cycle 2 – July 2025  
### Project: Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Demand Prediction

---

### Project Description:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that forecasts electric vehicle (EV) charging demand using historical vehicle registration data and regional characteristics.

With the rapid growth of EV adoption, accurate demand forecasting is essential for urban planners and policymakers to ensure proper infrastructure planning—especially for the installation of charging stations. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of regression techniques to predict future EV trends across counties.

---

### Problem Statement:

Using the electric vehicle dataset (which includes information on EV populations, vehicle types, and possibly historical charging usage), this project builds a model that forecasts future EV adoption. For example, predicting the number of electric vehicles in upcoming years based on past trends.

---

### Goal:

Build a regression model that forecasts future EV adoption demand based on historical trends in EV growth, types of vehicles, and regional data.

---

### Objectives:

- Analyze EV registration trends across time and regions  
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis  
- Build a regression model to forecast future EV adoption  
- Support sustainable infrastructure planning using predictive insights  

---

### Tools and Libraries Used:

- **Language**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

---

### Dataset Description:

This dataset includes monthly vehicle registration counts collected by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL), covering multiple counties from 2017-01-31 to 2024-02-29.

**Key Features:**

- **Date**: End-of-month registration snapshot  
- **County**: County of residence of the vehicle owner (Washington)  
- **State**: U.S. state associated with the record  
- **Vehicle Primary Use**: Passenger (83%) or Truck (17%)  
- **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)**: Fully battery-powered vehicles  
- **Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**: Partially battery-powered vehicles  
- **EV Total**: Sum of BEVs and PHEVs  
- **Non-EV Total**: Count of all non-electric vehicles  
- **Total Vehicles**: All registered powered vehicles  
- **Percent EV**: EV percentage of total vehicle population
